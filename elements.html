												<h3>Patient Data Automation</h3>
												<p>I established a Python-based connection to the patient database, streamlining the retrieval of patient records and appointment data for efficient management. Within the Python script, I developed specialized date functions to accurately extract appointment records, ensuring precise date interpretation. Additionally, I crafted a Python script that effectively identifies patients with annual visits, incorporating intricate date-related operations and conditional logic to account for leap years and month variations. This script was further programmed to generate comprehensive reports, offering valuable patient details that support medical professionals and administrators. By automating the patient database scan with Python, I not only saved time and effort but also enabled regular monitoring of annual visits, ultimately enhancing efficiency and patient care.</p>

												<h3>Automated Youtube Video Downloader</h3>
												<p>I developed a Python application aimed at simplifying the downloading of YouTube videos, capitalizing on Python's robust capabilities to ensure reliability and user-friendliness. The app features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, designed using Python and relevant libraries, ensuring a delightful experience for users seeking their favorite YouTube content. To enhance functionality, I seamlessly integrated the YouTube API, providing users with essential video details such as titles, durations, and quality options for informed downloading choices. Users have the flexibility to input either video URLs or keywords, catering to a diverse range of preferences and streamlining content access. To bolster the app's overall reliability, I implemented a robust URL validation mechanism, effectively preventing parsing errors during video downloads.</p>

									<h2 id="content">Cookie Clicker</h2>
									<p>I constructed the foundational structure of the game's web page using HTML, strategically accommodating various game elements and establishing a robust framework for interactivity. To breathe life into the core mechanics and create an immersive gaming experience, I harnessed the power of JavaScript to define game rules and behaviors. To further enhance user engagement, I incorporated event listeners in JavaScript, effectively capturing and responding to user actions. Additionally, I leveraged CSS to create an aesthetically pleasing game interface, improving visuals, layout, and animations to elevate the overall gaming experience.</p>
